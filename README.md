## About the project:

We had to build a letter guessing game where the computer randomly picks a letter. The user must guess the letter. Correct and incorrect guesses are displayed as wins and losses. The user's guesses are also displayed


## Techologies used to build:
  * HTML
  * CSS
  * Javascript

## Methodology:

I chose to use an array of vowels because the entire alphabet prooved to long to get a correct guess. The computer randomly picks from this array. I used the DOM methods we went over in class. The methodoly is outlined in the comments in the js.file.
